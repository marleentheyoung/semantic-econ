      "text": "Q: Great. Thanks so much. I think we've talked about this in the past, but I wanted to get Nicholas' thoughts on cycle management, specifically, I guess with retail distribution and in particular the MidCorp business, is that left amenable to cycle management?\nA: I mean, my view is it's a different type of cycle management. I mean the mid, what attractive with the MidCore business is it's more stable, so which mean that the cycle are more muted. We don't see the same price going up and down like [ph] XLT (00:42:31) and open because you got 40 and you make up 20 or 10. So I think in the Middle Market business, I think you have more \u2013 it's going up slower and it's going down much lower. So, I think that provides a much balance to our insurance book that has a large component of larger corporate risk that are more subject to large fluctuations in rates. So and yeah, the thing that's attractive to us is the value proposition of a carrier in the MidCorp segment is better because usually the distribution partner or the broker rely on the carrier to provide more than one line of business like. So, you're more important to him. The interaction with the carrier is more valued. So, you create the stickiness that really help \u2013 you're not competing solely on price, where when you deal with a large account and a risk manager, price is an important component of the value proposition. But here, I think so, it's less subject to price competition, which make it more stable and more attractive. And I think the thing that's interesting to us with the MidCorp acquisition is that the timing is pretty good because we've seen price increases on the property side because book is more exposed to secondary periods and the liability component of the book is subject to the discussion that we talked about before. So, I think our timing is really good. I think the book looks to be performing well enough. And so we're pretty excited to be able to finally get like a decent chunk of that business and to be at scale and being able to expand our footprint where we think is a very attractive part of the market.",

We haven't even closed the transaction yet, so I don't want to get into addressing fiscal 2023. Clearly, it is a part of the strategy that we had laid out to get to our fiscal 2023 targets. In terms of fiscal 2020, though, to back up to that piece, they are bringing along a fairly robust revenue stream in addition. So it will be slightly dilutive to profitability in fiscal 2020 and slightly dilutive to free cash flows. But we think we can contain it within our fiscal 2020 target of $1.35 billion of free cash flow. Yeah, Brad, one of the frequent questions I get when I'm out talking to the investment communities, they ask us, well, so how are you going to get to those construction numbers in the fiscal 2023 targets?

And is that volume increase sustainable?\nA: Yes. I think, I do recall I was, and we were as a team, unhappy with the performance we were having with Toepfer and we needed to fix that. That was not only providing low recurrence but a lot of volatility to our earnings, the way we were running it. Part of that was created by inefficiencies between the interface between Toepfer and ADM. Part of that it was because of the bloated structure, if you will, that was increasing our fixed costs. So when we bought the 20% of Toepfer, we brought both companies together and we moved some of the people to Rolle, to Geneva, and that allowed us to, first of all, have a more conservative view of the market, more coordinated view of the market between the origination and the destination that Toepfer provided. We had better utilization of our infrastructure, our logistics and certainly reduced the cost of the whole operations. So it's a more profitable operation; doesn't have that many fixed costs. So I think that overall, we improved the volumes because we have better coverage, but we also increased the margins out of that since we have lower cost. So I think the overall, M2M supply chain that you hear me talking from origination to the destination market, that's what the GTD has brought to us. And we should continue to see improvement into this. And you see this is a very true reflection. Ag Services with North America not being able to export that much because of the strong dollar still grew earnings 37% year-over-year, which is a significant improvement and a lot of that is because of this implementation.",

Sales were 5% lower as 5% higher bioactive volumes were more than offset by the impact of currency. Volumes growth in enzymes was driven by food market demand partially offset by lower biomaterial sales in the U.S. markets. Operating earnings of $56 million were even with prior year, overcoming negative the impact of currency. Operating margins continued to improve with a 100 basis point increase versus the prior year and a 540 basis point increase in total versus the first quarter of 2013. We expect higher volumes to continue in the second quarter driven by benefits from new product offerings in bioactives and increasing penetration into emerging markets. These stronger volumes will offset the negative impacts of currency and softer U.S. biomaterial volumes resulting in sales and operating earnings results, about flat with the prior year.",

      "text": "Q: Yeah, hi. Thanks a lot. And, Peter, we'll miss you on these calls after the Q1 call, but I have a few questions. One on Vrbo, with the migration complete, I think you talked about sort of the app update kind of taking some time. I'm a little surprised that it's still been seeing some weakness in January. Just give us some color on what exactly is the reason for that. And you talked about some green shoots, so give us some commentary there. And then maybe on One Key, can you talk about maybe where maybe the learnings are? Are you satisfied with the retention and the conversion so far? And how much room do you see for improvement from here on? And also in terms of international rollout, I think previously you talked about first half for that. Is that still on the cards?\nA: Yeah, so three good questions, lots of material there. Thanks, Naved. And you can call me any time if you miss my voice. First on Vrbo, I would say if you think about what we were doing at the tail end of last year, we were pushing to 100% migration on the app, everything moved over. And I think as we told everybody, these steps come with expected conversion degradation because you can't get everything to par. It takes forever. You have to move everything and start working on a new product. So we did that. I'd say that degradation was broadly in line or slightly better than what we hoped, but it was still there. And when you're doing that, you obviously are not investing as heavily in terms of marketing, because you're marketing people into a less converting product. So you kind of tend to back off on that spend because the spend becomes less efficient. As you now get to a place where the product is ramping back up very quickly, and we clawed back much of the conversion, which is I think the green shoots you're referring to, so we're actually gaining much faster than at least in my tenure I've ever seen us gain back in terms of one of these transitions. And the product is basically virtually back to the same levels of conversion. Now we can push back in and spend again. There is a little bit of a lag there because we've been under-spending, if you will, for a bit, waiting for the product to get to where it's converting as strongly. Now we are spending back up. So it will take a little time to get the engines fully operational, if you will, but it's more or less a sequence we expected to happen. It's just you're seeing it in our numbers now. As far as One Key goes, I think you said, am I satisfied with what we're seeing? I'd say I'm satisfied. It's still early days. We're seeing a lot of the indicators we want to see, as I alluded to. Cross-shopping is good. One of the things we hoped to achieve was getting Hotels.com customers who had fewer than ten stamps, people who hadn't gotten to earn anything yet, to be more engaged with the product, and we're seeing their repeat rates improve and their business improve. We're starting to see Vrbo customers earn and now burn their One Key rewards not only on Vrbo but other places. But again, those cycles are a bit long, so it will take longer for the millions of people who have now earned One Key cash on Vrbo who didn't used to, to come back and spend it because they may not rent a house for six months or a year. But we're laying in that opportunity with our customer base, and then we're crossing that opportunity across the brands. And we're seeing good signs across shopping and people starting to use more brands. So that's all consistent with what we hoped, but it's not a switch you flip when you talk about travel timing. Many people only travel once or twice a year, so it takes a little time, and we're building that in. So all good so far, but looking forward to it being even much more impactful over time. And then international expansion, we're not detailing which countries we're doing exactly when for competitive reasons, but One Key will roll out. We will push back into a number of markets that were historically pretty strong for us and have stayed reasonably strong. But we just think we have a lot of opportunity, and then we will have some tests into some markets that we haven't been as invested in historically where we think there's opportunity with the new product, new marketing approaches, et cetera. So a lot of exciting opportunity on the international front. It's not all dependent on One Key. We think there's opportunity regardless, but in the markets where it's relevant where we have multiple brands that have high brand awareness, we will be launching One Key there. And we think it will only enhance that.",

You'll note from the slide that both corn and soy futures were trading in a rather narrow range in the first four months of this year. Then, we saw some reports of adverse weather in Brazil and Argentina. In April, prices quickly reflected the uncertainty that brought. Corn moved almost $0.90 a bushel higher, soy moved $3.25 a bushel higher, that's an increase of 25% for corn, 36% for soy.",

And then the question is going be what happens with currency and planted acres in some of these crops over the next 12 to 18 months.

I think as each quarter goes on we understand exactly where those numbers are coming out both here and in Latin America, it's going to have the big impact on the recovery. We've got a number of new products that will be continuing to move forward in the marketplace, and we continue to make sure we're disciplined around our costs as well during a kind of turbulent time. Y eah, I think that's what is I think what differentiator is the pipeline.

Was that primarily driven by the Fed cuts that just boosted demand? And I guess linked to that is the pickup in delinquency in mortgage insurance, is that also just linked to more activity? I know you mentioned some seasonal factors. I don't know what those were, if there's any details we can have on that, please.\nA: Yeah, I'll start with that. I think the delinquency, again, yes, it's up, but it's absolutely very much within our expectations. The one thing maybe for people to remember or appreciate is given we've refinanced a significant part of the book in 2020 and 2021, we're now entering the, call it, the prime years of when delinquencies get reported. So, that's very much part of the, again, within our expectations. Right. So as new loans get on the books, usually it takes three, four years for them to show a bit of, just, call it really, really predictable and normal delinquency. So, that explains why in aggregate, delinquency rate is trending up a little bit. And more specifically on the seasonal aspect, I mean, every year, there's fairly predictable behaviors that we see from the borrowers, whether they get their tax refunds in the first quarter and then they catch up on their mortgages and whether they borrow more to buy holiday presents. So, that happens. And then the third quarter is typically expected and seen as we, I mean, we've seen that in the recent history that the delinquency rate just goes up in the third quarter without any more just seasonal. So again, we're very comfortable with the overall rate. And again, there's a little bit, the same differential that I mentioned last quarter related to the RMIC acquisition is still there. So it's a pre-financial crisis book that has its own set of characteristics. So we're, again, overall very happy, very comfortable with the delinquency rate. And in terms of the premium, your first part of the question, there's a couple of accounting differences and nuances this quarter. So I wouldn't read too much, I think, in the growth that we saw this quarter. It is a little bit of a catch-up on premium that was related to old \u2013 related to Bellemeade transactions on the ceded side. So, generally speaking, I'd say that mortgage segment is relatively flat in terms of growth opportunities.",

We have obviously thought a lot about the limitation liability point that you\u2019re raising.

I believe in one of your competitor's results they talked about ocean freight went heavily against them while they had good corn trading. So those kinds of comments I think are\nA: Look, there were a lot of complex, uncertain external factors, like weather, macro uncertainties, crop reports, to just to name a few, which influenced the commodity crop markets during the quarter, which made it more, much more challenging to navigate. And all surprises were not necessary reflecting underlying fundamentals. It makes positioning much more challenging, so we all operated more cautiously, and we walked away from some businesses that in a different environment we might have executed. We couldn't have been much more back to back transactions. Counterparty exposure becomes a concern, so as a result margins and merchandising were lower. So it was really very erratic movements. Four, five times it went all over the place, so you take risk off. You are more careful. Now for me this is very real that it's so much like this, so you are naturally more careful. I don't think this has \u2013 you should not see this being repeated in the next quarters. I think the next quarter should be more normal.

        "question": "First question, just want to go back to volatility. So typically Alberto, and I always think that volatility is good for your business in that really your gain is to be a good risk manager. You made comments in the press release and on the prepared script about risk management did not go favorably in the quarter. So really two questions here, the first one is does risk management results in the third quarter, do they have implications in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, a million people are going to call and just simply ask what actually did go wrong in risk management. Can you talk a little bit about that? I believe in one of your competitor's results they talked about ocean freight went heavily against them while they had good corn trading. So those kinds of comments I think are",
        "answer": "Look, there were a lot of complex, uncertain external factors, like weather, macro uncertainties, crop reports, to just to name a few, which influenced the commodity crop markets during the quarter, which made it more, much more challenging to navigate. And all surprises were not necessary reflecting underlying fundamentals.

On Helene, our view is that it's going to be the type of event that probably will have a bit more leakage than you would otherwise expect.

But, no question that, what we thought, what people thought might have been a really scary and large event. It doesn't seem to have materialized. I think industry estimates are coming down as we speak. So, call it, the $30 billion plus or minus market loss seems to be about right given what we know today. And in terms of our own loss related to that, I mean, again, more to come, but you shouldn't expect anything unusual from us.

How we're thinking about managing the work or the earnings at risk in these assets, right, that's the physical flows involved through all of our handling, processing, distribution assets. So, you think about it, it's all the Grains and Oilseeds on the way in, and then all the products on the way out, as well as all the freight and logistics that surround that. So, there's not only the inherent risk that we're helping manage in our assets, but that we're helping our customers on both ends of the value chain, manage theirs as well. And then, ultimately, just philosophically, the net of those risks, right, is the risk that we have to \u2013 the remainder risk that we have to manage. And that is, we're keeping it, the amount of risk we're taking appropriate not only for our earnings power, but for the environment that we're operating in, which is fairly challenging. But I'll tell you, Robert Wagner has only been here a month and, of course, Brian Zachman since January, but couldn't be more pleased with how those two leaders and their teams are partnering across the control and the commercial functions. They're driving simplification and transparency, which helps us with our speed to act in managing the risks inherent in our business. And, at the end of the day, right, it's about the key focus on the right things, so we're getting the right information to the right people at the right time, which helps maximize the earnings in our portfolio, but it also helps eliminate the unforced error. So, there was a good foundation of risk management here, but we're building on that, making good progress already, and we've got some targets for some other improvements. So, excited about the team we're building.",

So, I guess just sort of running through those numbers there, looks like if I take out MidCorp, that was about a 57% underlying loss ratio for the sort of core Arch Insurance business. And so that ticked up a little over 100 basis points versus last quarter and also on a year-over-year basis. So I'm just wondering if you could help me think through some of the drivers of that increase.\nA: Yeah, I'd say, again, it's \u2013 Nicholas touched on it, it's growth related and mix, right, in the sense that where you saw us grow this quarter and I don't think you have the time to look at \u2013 in the supplement how we report the lines of business, which is \u2013 which we have changed this quarter relative to the past, more growth in casualty and other liability lines of business, both, I mean, primarily on an occurrence basis, claims made which is more professional lines book and cyber, that has come down.

      "text": "Q: Good morning, guys. So appreciate some of the color on the cyclical end-markets and some of the industrial noise. I guess as you're thinking about second half, the CapEx line in general in terms of instruments has been sort of a source of weakness now for I don't know, maybe 12, 18 months. I think probably the weakest period for instruments since maybe 2008, 2009. Obviously, you've got a lot of new products coming in, that you can control. But on the stuff you can't, I guess how are you thinking about the degree of risk from just general macro slowdown, so PMIs continue to decelerate, some of the challenges in China, we know of Europe, obviously the threat of hard Brexit there, that's tough to figure out but seems like a risk. And then layering in what we know about 4+7, obviously we were there in China not long ago. It seems certainly like there's going to be an expansion. And so, again that's something not in your control and may end up positive, but still causes some lack of visibility. So I guess how are you thinking about the cadence of the product roll-outs, what you can control versus the risks of what you can't control because it seems like the key to getting Waters back to its more normalized growth rate is obviously going to be getting that CapEx line back to a more \u2013 or the instrument line back to a more normal level. Like how do you put that whole pie together as you think about getting back to on the 3%, 4%, 5% instrument growth by next year which you'd need to kind of get back to your long-term growth rates?\nA: Yeah. Thank you, Ross, and good morning. And that's exactly the goal here is to get that instrument line moving, and you correctly pointed out that there is a lot in the new cadence that we do control, and we're really excited about that, like I said on the prepared remarks. We've invested assertively. We've really put our heads down to improve our overall product portfolio, and we're really, I think, going to be able to see the positive benefits to that and it certainly has been something that's energized our customers and our field organization as we look into the back half of the year, and so we definitely try to focus on what we can control there. In terms of a lot of the macro pieces that you identified, we've tried to put together a guide that really bakes in a lot of that question, if you will, and there are different points that you mentioned. The general industrial slowdown is certainly something that's affected our business and that's been primarily a European question as our industrial business in the U.S. was actually quite positive in the quarter and has been positive. The European environment is really characterized by a lot of uncertainty particularly as you point out around Brexit. There's no question that the northern part of Europe has, in particular, been impacted by that. We've seen more pressure in the northern part of Europe than we have in the Southern part of Europe but obviously, that's going to work its way towards a resolution point one way or another here by the end of the year. And of course, in China, it's a variety of factors there, and most prominent to us has been 4+7 in the food question, but like I mentioned earlier, I think there's a little more moderation around 4+7 expectations as participants in the market come to grips with the new process, but also see the growth that's inherent in this marketplace. We don't know exactly what Phase II is going to look like there. We do understand that, unlike Phase I there may be multiple winners per tender accepted which could moderate the dynamic overall, so some uncertainty but we believe all those factors are baked into our near-term guide here.",

I think if we look at the book, they're set at around 64%. It's up significantly from a decade ago, around 40%, 42%. So I'm wondering what risk you guys see from that declining given the weaker market prices we've seen over the last couple years and what headwinds to think about from that over the next maybe year or two I guess.\nA: If you think about the operating lease just in general, I think hopefully the read-through as you looked at the quarter is things seemed to have stabilized at least in the short term in terms of the losses that were recognized. No additional impairments, those sorts of things. Obviously, the forecasted income for Financial Services stayed the same, all positive signs. But to your point, I would say in the near term, short to midterm, there's still certainly risk. As we look at future maturities, we continue to work hard to reduce the return rates on those maturities as well as finding more effective ways to dispose of those when they get returned so that the loss rates are not as significant. But as long as we stay at these lower levels, as long as used equipment prices continue to be at more depressed levels; I think that continues to bear watching and certainly has risk. So while we take some comfort in the short term, with the stabilization we saw in the quarter, it's going to be a while before we're willing to say we're out of the woods there. And so to your point, stay tuned and certainly we would cite that as some additional risk.",

In both of those, we're continuing to gain share.

Are you going to kind of cherry-pick some of the best products and shelve some of the other ones, or should we generally view the comments about some of the pipeline activities as on track?\nA: No, we will leverage the capabilities of both organizations. I think that there's mutual respect for the innovation, skill sets within both of these organizations, and the culture as it relates to innovation, so if you think about the combination of these businesses with concentrations in various product categories and the way innovation has been conducted over the course of many years within medical devices, is there's an element of that innovation that is committed to incremental advancements. And those will always continue, whether it's in the form of line extensions or the like. What this transaction allows us to do, though, on a combined basis is continue the incremental innovation and yet have a broader portfolio and array of innovative solutions that are going to be more game -changing, broader in the form of joint preservation and early intervention technologies, and advance the cause in preoperative and intraoperative technologies that can help change the way these solutions are delivered and the efficiencies with which these solutions are delivered. So, on a combined basis, we're going to be able to get after rapidly addressing more of the current unmet needs. And then as Jim and I both referenced, in a more comprehensive way partner with other stakeholders in the healthcare industry in a manner that allows them to improve patient care and at the same time do that in a cost-effective manner. So we're going to be able to do all the things that we've done historically on a standalone basis, but when combined, more of it and on an accelerated basis across a broader span of the innovation opportunity and the scope of addressing the problems and challenges that oth er stakeholders face in the evolving healthcare market.",

I know in the past you've said you think they're too wide still. So has anything changed there in the past few months? And with respect to how wide they've been for how long, has that surprised you at all given where we are in the cycle relative to past cycles?\nA: All I can really say about it is as you would envision. The bid/ask price is really a function of a number of factors, obviously including the business climate. But also what I would tell you is the unique capability and assessment from individual investors. Certainly as commodity prices remain low, it will impact the dynamics. I really don't have a view to share with respect to where it's going. I would tell you from our perspective, it's business as normal.

In the past you\u2019ve had interim release of the product embedded in the Acrobat release. I\u2019m wondering how a potential release like that might factor into your guidance for the year? Thanks.\nA: Sure, Walter. As we have said at the recent financial analyst meeting again, we\u2019re targeting 10% annual growth for the entire company. And we tried to break it out by our different growth segments that we talked about. In the Creative segment, specifically, what we are hearing from our customers is this ability for Adobe to help them with their entire workflow associated with both authoring as well as publishing for multiple formats is an increasingly important one. As you know, there are multiple OSs being released. We expect to see probably another set of tablet devices also come out in the first part of the year. So while we\u2019re not announcing new products, what we\u2019ve said is that we anticipate giving new functionality to these customers to help them deal with that multi-format, multi-screen proliferation.

And how sustainable is that in your mind?\nA: So Matt, thank you for the question. We're very happy with where we are with academic and government. I mean, first half of the year, double-digit growth. This quarter, 16% or so growth. But I'll remind you that this is a lumpy market and we have a low base from last year, right? So if you look at a three-year stack growth rate, we're roughly 40-ish percent inorganic growth rate in that segment. It's very heavily levered towards instruments and instruments did extremely well this quarter and the last quarter.

That said, we are \u2013 we have initiated our focus and our turnaround in that segment but we are far from done, right?

So, we certainly want to continue to drive innovation across the portfolio. And I think we've done a nice job of that over the last couple of years.

We think there is great opportunities for us to expand there. We can leverage the strength we have in our core business to build a stronger presence there. And those markets are quite fragmented, so we feel that's a good position for us \u2013 or good markets for us to enter or expand in I should say, we're already in them. But perhaps one other thought, as you think about adjacencies, don't just think about product terms, like software or services or hardware, but also think about solutions, the solutions that we've been talking about like SmartLens and SmartPack are a combination of hardware, software and services, and we're definitely investing in building those kinds of capabilities on top of the data platform, Savanna that we introduced.

I think, again, Jeff, we'd point to the fact that rather than commenting like on specific dollars, we don't think \u2013 the headwinds themselves, we don't think will be headwinds because we think we're going to take and we are taking actions to mitigate those through pricing, supply chain moves and operational strategies, things of that nature.

When we have to move it to other countries, whether that'd be other countries in Asia or India, there's other low-cost countries around the world that have suddenly become popular outside of some of the targeted countries that are impacted by the tariffs, it will take time to resource supply chains to those countries because they just don't have the same level of development that exists today in China. So, we continue to work with supply chain partners. We'll continue to work very hard with our teams internally. We have a separate team that we've established internally here that's targeting \u2013 it's a cross functional team that's targeting all aspects of tariffs because obviously, the impact of that is \u2013 we actually believe it's something we can turn into a positive for ourselves.

      "text": "Q: Okay, great. And then the follow-up is just on the Henry Hub gas market here. As you think about overall gas flat prices, we do have a cold winter, you can start to really design some real upside scenarios. Can you talk about what you ultimately think creates a ceiling on natural gas in that scenario? Historically, we've thought about gas-to-coal substitution as the balancing item. But with as much coal-fired capacity having been shut as it has, that mechanism might not be as pronounced. But you also have the potential for Canadian gas flow, for example, or shutting down the LNG arm. So how do you think about what is the mechanism on the natural gas side that can offset the potential demand impact of a very cold winter?\nA: Thanks, Neil. And I'll turn that to Jeff, our gas expert. Yeah, Neil, that is an intriguing question because we've thought about that here too. The impact of the demand across the country currently with record exports into Mexico and obviously a very robust LNG export market that is fairly consistent day in, day out. You'd get a few hiccups here and there with [indiscernible] (00:41:31) maintenance and things like that. But it's been fun over the last couple of years to watch this demand increase. Even in the Pacific Northwest, you mentioned the Canadian imports. It's been interesting to watch as we see hydro up there anything the commission [indiscernible] (00:41:54) more exports from Canada headed in that direction and then to the upper Midwest. And that's actually influenced the storage levels in the upper Midwest. I think they're somewhere well over 100 Bcf around this time last year, same as the East storage levels. So your question about how high can it go is a good question. And in our hedge committee meetings, of course, we think about that or I wish about that. And fundamentally, we're set up for a good year over here. Capital is in place. And yes, we had a good winter in certain spots of the country this year. It'll tax the system and there will be price increases. And we're prepared to meet the commitments of our customers. Gas source levels will not get to where they were at this time last year. That's a well-known fact. So how high can it go is relative, particularly in the New York market, the Boston market, the Chicago market and other areas that do like the amount of storage that we had last year. So if I was a gambler or a speculator, I don't know if there is a cap necessarily for $4, $5, $6. We've seen $8 in New York market in the past. So I think it's all on the table at this point.",

Can you guys tell us what percent of your energy investments right now are income-positive with commodity prices where they are, excluding hedges?\nA: I don't know if we can answer that question specifically for you.

But just to frame it, direct energy for us is a very, very large \u2013 a small percentage of our overall exposure. So, to put numbers around, if you look at our credit AUM, it's less than 3.5% energy. If you look at our private equity portfolio, it's about 2% energy. And if you look at our balance sheet in terms of its exposure to direct ene rgy, it's about 6%, 6.5%, give or take. So it's a very small percentage of our overall third-party AUM and our overall balance sheet. And in terms of the actual investments that we still have, in terms of the vast majority of those are cash flowing. Keep in mind, what we're left with in terms of our energy income and growth fund are largely unlevered positions in natural gas assets or oil assets or in the royalty or drilling space. But to date, they're performing reasonably well given the commodity environment; we have hedges in place for most of those. And what I would point you to in terms of focus, as you think about marks on that 2% to 6% of our assets, depending on how you look at it, is really what matters is what happens with the forward curve three years to five years out. It's basically a DCF base valuation, but that's going to have the biggest impact.",

But just to frame it, direct energy for us is a very, very large \u2013 a small percentage of our overall exposure. So, to put numbers around, if you look at our credit AUM, it's less than 3.5% energy. If you look at our private equity portfolio, it's about 2% energy. And if you look at our balance sheet in terms of its exposure to direct ene rgy, it's about 6%, 6.5%, give or take. So it's a very small percentage of our overall third-party AUM and our overall balance sheet. And in terms of the actual investments that we still have, in terms of the vast majority of those are cash flowing. Keep in mind, what we're left with in terms of our energy income and growth fund are largely unlevered positions in natural gas assets or oil assets or in the royalty or drilling space. But to date, they're performing reasonably well given the commodity environment; we have hedges in place for most of those. And what I would point you to in terms of focus, as you think about marks on that 2% to 6% of our assets, depending on how you look at it, is really what matters is what happens with the forward curve three years to five years out. It's basically a DCF base valuation, but that's going to have the biggest impact.",

      "text": "Q: Okay, thanks. I'm sure these questions have been covered, but if I could ask again, please, of these two initiatives, the replatforming of the brands, particularly the Vrbo brand, and then the One Key strategy, I assume these are more like snowball events. Have you already seen an impact on the business or on demand cross- selling, retention, acquisition from these so far? Or if not, could you lay out expectations of when we would? Thank you very much.\nA: Yeah, Mark. I'll give you a quick answer. I think we sort of addressed some of it already. But basically the Vrbo transition to the unified stack is more of just an execution thing. I think what it gives us is the opportunity now to accelerate Vrbo in terms of feature and test-and-learn and grow faster, as I mentioned to the rest of the group. We dug a hole. We knew we would when we moved it to the new stack that conversion would go down. We have been digging out of that hole. We're about back to par, but we didn't do it to get to par. We did it to accelerate far past that, and now we have the opportunity in Vrbo riding on the same rails that the other brands get all the benefit of all the testing, shared testing opportunities, winners that we found other places and so forth. So we're excited about the progression of that product, but it had to go through the bad to get to the good. As far as One Key goes, I also mentioned we feel very good about the early indicators. Yes, there is more cross- shopping. Yes, we're seeing more repeat from certain pools of customers that we thought would benefit from this, like Hotels.com customers who had less than 10 stamps in our old system and people, if you will, who hadn't earned any benefit. Now they have benefit, and they're coming back more. And that's what we want to see. But as I also mentioned, while millions of people have earned One Key cash on Vrbo, a small percentage of them have respent it, and that just has to do with the cycles of the booking windows for Vrbo and if people rarely book more than once or twice a year. So we expect to see those people back in. That's why I said we built up this value, and now that value needs to be realized as they come back direct later as they use that One Key cash across other brands with more cross-shopping. Like, that's the dream, and of course getting Expedia and Hotels.com members to use their One Key cash on Vrbo, which we've also seen. But, again, those cycles aren't every month. People do that once, twice a year. So we're seeing good early signals, but it's all building. And that's why I'm excited. It's going to be a slow build, but it's going to be a great sticky thing for us over time. And, again, we'll keep more and more people as we get more of the right people in, as we keep more of them, and as they get to use all of our products and again we capture more wallet share from them. That's what we're pushing for.",

Really, what we're trying to show on slide 12 is how our cost structure is and is not moving throughout 2023. So when we built the budget, we had some strong indications that our leading cost indicators were coming down. And most of those have come to fruition. So you can see with our midyear re-pricings, we gained ground on rigs, OCTG, frac sand, but it's really the remaining market piece of our cost structure that just hasn't seen the same deflation. So that part's been pretty sticky. It's a bunch of smaller services driven by really underpinned by labor and fuel. And we just haven't seen that deflation there.

Look, I think, we've conceded that a shorter length of stay is a bit more of an operational challenge, which I think is probably intuitive to people who think about it, that turning over patients more quickly requires a bit more of an effort, et cetera. But we also acknowledge that, to some degree, that's the way the business is headed. And so we'll deal with that. I think we have a point of view. And, again, sort of harkening back to an earlier exchange I had, that 5% revenue growth, at some point, is restoring that number is not unrealistic. It continues to be in our minds very achievable. We think of that as sort of 2.5% to 3% volume growth and 2.5% to 3% pricing growth.

So, look, at a high level, one of the things I'm really excited about, the thing with the really long name, the Advanced Digital Construction Management System program that the US government rolled out, that is the program related to the money that's designed to help departments of transportation look at their infrastructure, look at their processes, and start modernizing their digital processes around design and construction of infrastructure. That's an important step in getting a lot of these departments of transportation to really start thinking about how they get ready to spend more money on infrastructure and do it better and address the serious capacity challenges we have around materials, manpower and dollars with regards to what we have to do. So pretty excited about that because that's an open door to having new conversations with these departments about how they do things. Our focus has not changed. We are very much focused on water and road and rail, and we continue to innovate and drive improvements in those areas. I think our biggest differentiator is what we bring to market is modern architectures. We bring to market more cloud-based solutions, more owner-based solutions for managing the infrastructure once you have it, and really just more technology that's stitched together in different ways. So we're looking forward to having that discussion with the departments of transportation over the next months and coming years, and I think you're going to start to see real change in some of those organization.",

      "text": "Q: Hey, good morning. First of all, congratulations to the whole team for, again, rising to this enormous challenge that you have to face there. And I just wanted to ask a high level question first. You talked at the Analyst Day, Aaron and York, a lot about the rollout of the prime power demand response opportunity, the potential to double the TAM. I'm asking this question first just because I think we're very quickly going to be answering questions for investors around difficult comparisons and where does the growth come from down the road. And this just sounds like a very, very important driver. So, if you can give an update there and when we start to see more of the impact from that initiative.\nA: Yeah, thanks, Brian. So we talked about a lot of things at the Investor Day, but we talked about one thing in particular there, was around our Lead Gas initiative part of our strategy, which today, \u2013 so, there's two components of that. The first component is the continued substitution in the market, the existing market of legacy diesel, a traditional genset being switched over to gas. And we're starting to see that and have been seeing that for a number of years, and as we've said many times before, we believe we're the leader in that industry. We also believe that there's a lot of legs to go yet, a lot of room to run with that substitution. And we estimate the U.S. market today is about 60% diesel gensets, 40% natural gas. And that's changed dramatically over the last 30 years. And we believe that it's going to continue to change in a very positive fashion, and we're going to be at the forefront of capturing that. To that end, we're introducing a lot of new products, larger nodes, additional product options and features, controls, things that will, in our minds, make us \u2013 make those gensets, even in the larger KW ranges, very attractive; natural gas versus diesel. Longer-term, we also talk about one of the growth areas with natural gas being the potential for demand response, time of use type programs, combined heat and power, other uses for that natural gas generator technology beyond the standby market. So we're referring to it as kind of beyond standby internally here. And so, today, we have non-standby ratings or limited prime and prime ratings for certain gensets, and basically de-rated machines with some existing \u2013 with some additional feature sets, and obviously, the appropriate certifications when it comes to emissions profiles for those products. Those are in the market today. And, in fact, we see, in particular, there's a couple of pockets of strength we're already seeing around certain regions. Canada being one of them where time of use type programs where the generator can be run at times of day were very similar to what you'd see in a classic demand response type program, just more on an individual site location as opposed to being aggregated. An individual owner operator can reduce their utility bill by running that generator during peak times. We believe in the future that this is an incredibly important potential growth avenue for power generation companies in particular, but given our position as the leader in natural gas, we definitely like how we're uniquely positioned there to take advantage of that and capitalize on that. But that's a long-term trend, and those are things that are going to take time to develop. There are macro trends of utility costs. There are macro trends of regulation. There are macro trends of natural gas pricing and the input costs, but that spark spread, as we've talked about, continues to be favorable for those programs. So, it's going to play out over time. We think that the conversion from diesel to natural gas on the standby market is a very real opportunity that's being executed on now. We have new products in the market and, we continue to see, as we said in our prepared remarks, very good results on natural gas product lines.",

Canada being one of them where time of use type programs where the generator can be run at times of day were very similar to what you'd see in a classic demand response type program, just more on an individual site location as opposed to being aggregated. An individual owner operator can reduce their utility bill by running that generator during peak times. We believe in the future that this is an incredibly important potential growth avenue for power generation companies in particular, but given our position as the leader in natural gas, we definitely like how we're uniquely positioned there to take advantage of that and capitalize on that. But that's a long-term trend, and those are things that are going to take time to develop. There are macro trends of utility costs. There are macro trends of regulation. There are macro trends of natural gas pricing and the input costs, but that spark spread, as we've talked about, continues to be favorable for those programs. So, it's going to play out over time. We think that the conversion from diesel to natural gas on the standby market is a very real opportunity that's being executed on now. We have new products in the market and, we continue to see, as we said in our prepared remarks, very good results on natural gas product lines.",

      "text": "Q: Okay. Can you elaborate more on your efficiency guidance? I mean, record EPS, lower guidance for efficiency. So it's a little bit of a disconnect. I know you've addressed that, but you're lowering the range from 100 basis points to 400 basis points of positive operating leverage to 100 basis points to 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. I think what you said is the FDIC benefit you pushed out and just a little bit of mortgage softness, maybe there's some investing in there. That's still a pretty wide range for just two quarters left. I don't know if you can be more specific to the 100 basis points to 300 basis points annual positive operating leverage. And I think the reason for the sensitivity to this is you guys did miss your efficiency targets a few years ago. Your efficiency did become the worst it's been for BB&T in a decade. And, look, it's still good progress, it's still good efficiency, but it hasn't been the best efficiency like it once was. So what's your commitment to that 55% short term? I guess, can you define short term? Is that maybe in 2020? Could it be next year? What's your commitment and conviction to improving that efficiency since you're pulling back a little bit your guidance here?\nA: So, Mike, I'll give you a [ph] conceptual (00:57:12) and Daryl can give you some detail. Our commitment and conviction is absolute, but you just need to remember, Mike, what happened to us. Frankly, during the 1990s and the 2000s, we were growing really, really fast [ph] from mergers (00:57:31). We kind of had to and we did that well. But in that period of time, we didn't invest as much as [ph] \u2013 invest in fact (00:57:39) maybe we should have in the backroom. So as we headed into the last 10 years, we simply had to substantially ramp up our investment and updating a number of our systems, like our new accounting system, our new commercial loan system, our new data center, and a long list of other systems. So we had an accelerated I'd say three or four-year period of substantial ramp-ups. I told our people at the time, I told the market at the time that it would drive our efficiency ratio up, but it would start subsiding. That's exactly what happened. It popped up to 59.5%, as I recall, on an adjusted basis. It's now down to about 57.3%. And it's moving on a trajectory as we projected in that 55ish kind of range. Obviously, the denominator matters and we've talked about that in the past. But denominator aside, if it's somewhat neutralized, yeah, I feel good about being able to make all the investments we're making and moving towards that 55-ish kind of target because we are really figuring out some neat ways to do our business better. I mean, this isn't just about trying to work harder and do what you did [indiscernible] (00:58:57) just working a little harder. This is about working smarter. In this business today, that's required. And the good news is there are substantial new tools, think AI, machine learning, robotics, et cetera, that we've never had before. And so, yeah, we're confident and excited about it. Okay. So, a little detail, Mike. You want to focus on the things that we can control. So, on the expense side, we've been doing a great job this year on controlling expenses. If you look at our FTEs year-over-year, we're down 1,600 FTEs and we hadn't missed a beat in how we're operating our company. As that goes forward, I would expect our FTEs also to continue to be right-sized going into the future. As Kelly mentioned, in the branches, we're rationalizing the branch system. We also have a big program within our back office facilities. We're just starting some testing and learning on the front office facilities. So when we started this venture, we had about 21 million square feet in the company. Right now, we're about 18.5 million square feet, and that continues to come down. We'll probably over the next two to three years, everything else being equal, be close to 16 million square feet, maybe a little bit better than that. We're going to use those costs, as Kelly said, redeploy them in robotics and digital to help drive revenue, help continue to drive costs. All that comes together. So if we can continue to keep costs flat and continue to make the investments, we feel that based on the economy, revenue could be 1% or 2% or could be 3%, 4%, 5%. We will get what we can within our risk appetite, but we would definitely generate positive operating leverage.",

        "text": "Q: Okay. Can you elaborate more on your efficiency guidance? I mean, record EPS, lower guidance for efficiency. So it's a little bit of a disconnect. I know you've addressed that, but you're lowering the range from 100 basis points to 400 basis points of positive operating leverage to 100 basis points to 300 basis points of positive operating leverage. I think what you said is the FDIC benefit you pushed out and just a little bit of mortgage softness, maybe there's some investing in there. That's still a pretty wide range for just two quarters left. I don't know if you can be more specific to the 100 basis points to 300 basis points annual positive operating leverage.

Can you just give us some color there, what drove the negative gain on sale?\nA: Yeah. So, in the quarter, as we were looking at optimizing our balance sheet, we actually did a sale of conforming loans to the GSEs of about $5 billion. The impact of that was to have a loss on the sale of the portfolio, given that they've been originated at lower rates. So, as rates are higher, the fair value of the loans is lower. Against that, if you were to look at the rest of the P&L, you'll see a benefit in net interest income, because the interest rate risk of that has been transferred to the Treasury Department. So, it's geography. It's a loss on the sale of a portfolio, against which there's funding breakage in NII. Just so that you know, when we \u2013 a mortgage loan with RWA at 50% versus a security at 20% with better liquidity value, we did reinvest some of those proceeds in mortgage- backed securities in Treasury.

First of all, how quickly could you move into a Phase III trial depending on how the Alios nucs data looks? How quickly could you move into a Phase III interferon-free combo trial? And a question on INCIVEK, have you seen any indications of doctors warehousing patients in light of the recent developments in HCV? Thanks.\nA: So the first question was how fast can you move on the Alios. I think the first thing is we have to go into Phase II. We are currently in biokinetic studies, which is a Ib and this will happen in the second half of this year, shortly after we have data available. So I think we are preparing for that and then moving hopefully one or several dependent on data outcome regimens into a Phase II setting. And then basically from there it's not a question of Phase III, it's a question of pivotal drugs in general. And you have to develop a development strategy basically that takes care of it. The only thing we have said is which I want to reiterate is, we have a chance with our regimens to basically come by the end of 2014 to the first submission for regulatory approval in an all-oral setting, whatever that setting might be. Jeff M. Leiden President, CEO & Independent Director, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. A This is Jeff. I guess the one other thing that I would add is obviously we are as are others aiming for shorter and shorter trials with these all-oral regimens and hopefully getting down to as short as12 weeks. And that does have a major impact on the timing and the speed at which one can move into these trials, which is quite different from the previous trials containing peg/riba. And on the question related to warehousing, this is something we talked quite a bit about during our fourth quarter call and we had done some fairly extensive research looking into this. So although we're delighted in that we are also participating in the development of potential all-oral therapies, at this point, we don't have any data to suggest that there is additional secondary warehousing beyond what goes on all the time as physicians triage patients into appropriate therapies. We're ready for the next question.",

And we\u2019ve made a number of investments in the \ncontext of Aon Broking around that, both in how we understand our system, which is really \nwhat the Global Risk Insight Platform is about, and really it\u2019s just understanding every trade \nwe make in the system globally, every day on a real-time basis. \n \nThis has been a multi-year investment. It\u2019s given us tremendous capability that we didn\u2019t \nhave before. It lets us be able to evaluate leakage. It helps us really monitor and manage \nAon Broking. It gives us market insights. It helps us understand penetration we\u2019re having \nwith clients, and how we think about that. So it\u2019s really a whole range of things we\u2019ve done \nreally across our overall system. \n \nFor us, the GRIP is really a \u2013 the risk impact platform is really an engine. It gives us a very \nunique use of and view on data, that we don\u2019t think anybody else has. It provides an \nopportunity for us to both talk to clients around greater benchmarking than they\u2019ve ever \nseen before. It also gives us the opportunity to talk to markets, right, and create a fee-based \noffering to the extent it can help markets understand situations and their strategy better. \n \nSo it really gives us a full range of things we can do. And we\u2019ve now got it implemented in 20 \ncountries around the world. Roughly $33 billion of premium flow are entered into the \nsystem. As I mentioned in my opening comments, 500,000 trades have been placed or \nmonitored in this. And it\u2019s really, for us, it\u2019s an overall effort begun, just beginning to really \npay dividends across the Aon Broking platform. \n \n\n    corrected transcript \n \nAon Corp.\nAON\nQ2 2010 Earnings Call\nJul. 30, 2010\nCompany\u25b2\nTicker\u25b2\nEvent Type\u25b2\nDate\u25b2\n \n       www.CallStreet.com  \u2022  1-877-FACTSET \u2022  Copyright \u00a9 2001-2010 CallStreet \n \n11\n<Q \u2013 Meyer Shields",

      "text": "Q: Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I can do one higher-level one first. If we think about project sanctions and your investment in long-cycle projects right now, where do you think you are in the deferral or reinvestment process? Have you seen costs come down to a level at this point on long-cycle projects where you feel like it's time to reaccelerate investment? Have you not deferred much in your view at this point? Or probably I guess what have you seen on FIDs? What FIDs could you expect going forward, or do you think that costs need to come down further for you to get reengaged?\nA: Ryan, I guess I would tell you that we haven't disengaged. We've maintained an active investment program. In addition to the 32 major upstream projects that I've talked about and then the financial \u2013 FID decisions that we've taken on some of our downstream and chemical projects, we've given you some line of sight on the next tranche of upstream investment opportunities that are currently in various stages of either development planning or even in the early stages of pre-engineering, if you will. It gives you a sense for what we're working on. I want to remind you that we are capturing real-time benefits through capital efficiency in our investment program. Those are structural improvements that we're capturing. Yes, there are market improvements that we're experiencing as well. But as we make the investment decisions, we test those investments across a very wide range of prices, including commodity prices, and that's well within the current price environment. So the investments are very robust, resilient to a number of factors that can significantly influence them, and that positions us very well to continue a continuous investment program, not get the inefficiencies of the stop and the starts, obviously underpinned by our financial capability, and allows us to further capture economic uplift in the current market climate.",

In terms of if oil prices were to stay similar to the current range for a little bit more of an extended time and you look at the balance of your exposure that you just described upstream, midstream, downstream, I mean, to what extent do you see that as kind of a headwind versus tailwind for the company?\nA: Well, I'm not an oil guru, but we're watching with great anticipation like everyone else what the impact will be at what oil price does different activity change. But the end customers don't \u2013 they're not changing their CapEx plans based on movements week to week on oil prices. They're waiting \u2013 it takes a year to do a directionally drilled well in a tight shale formation. So it's not something that you turn on and off on weekly or monthly basis. So when you look at overall CapEx plans. But in particular if you take a look at the two businesses I just talked about, LNG. The thing that's driving LNG right now is the opportunity to export LNG from North America. If you take a look at it, we have a vast amount of natural gas that is priced for the first time below its BTU value. Since the deregulation of natural gas for the first time, natural gas is trading at a price lower than its BTU value. And with the abundance of natural gas, you can see us having a real opportunity to export that gas to other countries, basically Asia and Europe. And there's four or five projects underway right now, then there's 17 being planned. And then on Process, on the petrochem the side same thing. All the \u2013 a lot of the investments left over time as natural gas, which is the feedstock of petrochem, so it's the natural gas liquids, as they went up in price, that overcapacity left the country and now it's coming back and all for the same reason: natural gas prices look pretty low. And so those two, in particular, benefit from the longer-term lower cost of natural gas. And so that's why I'm encouraged and I'm worried less about what oil prices do to those two things than I am to what it would do to E&P.",

First, to circle back to tariffs, it sounds like you've quantified the potential impact from the increase on Lists 1 through 3 and List 4A, but it's not embedded in the 2019 guide. Is the messaging that you do feel you can fully offset that, or is the message that you're working to offset and you'll update us with the magnitude of offset at some point?\nA: Thanks, Judah. Yes. Short answer. Listen, I mean, we're six days from the last change, right? So, I mean, here's how we've gone through the year. The merchant teams had mitigated List 1, 2 and 3 as we knew it. Then when List 4A, 4B first came out, we had plans on that and actually on our trip to Asia, felt very good about where we were on that. And then, of course, the most recent changes make that the callout of our most recent news. Well, the things we're doing are working pretty darn well. I would say the vendor community is stepping up. We have done things like we've said before, we can \u2013 we've really worked hard on changing how we're packing things or the packaging and how many units can we get on containers, so we can land the overall cost lower. We've been able to move I would say modestly, $100 million, on some of the buying trips out of China with our strategy of China Plus One. I give credit to our merchants. This is about negotiating a vendor at a time to make those differences. And that's why I went into this call, we want to give you the math to give you some sense of the scale and really, while it's work we've got to do from six days ago, I have confidence in the group that we'll mitigate it for the balance of the year.",

But with that in mind, just wanted to get your thoughts in terms of cadence of how things look into Q2. But, importantly, if you just look at bid activity relative to last year, if you could give any comment on bid activity beyond just pure volumes. Thank you very much.\nA: Absolutely, Kathryn. There are a couple of things. If we look at the change in average daily tons in the quarter, it was actually remarkably predictable, which is one reason that we feel as confident as we are. We're sitting almost precisely where we thought we would be. So, if you go back to the guidance that we gave in February, we said we thought Q1 would be more normal and that's what we were anticipating for the balance of the year. So, if we look at what January shipments look like relative to changes in average daily tons, January was down 7%. If we look in February, and again this ties to the commentary that I gave that, number one, it was normal almost everywhere except in Texas, it was the heaviest rain month in record-keeping history for February. Shipments were down 14%. Then we go into March and suddenly shipments were up 2% over, as you recall, last year was not a March that anyone would have been ashamed of. So we like the rhythm and cadence of what we see. It's always been our custom and practice not to talk specifically about months in the next quarter. I know others have done that. I will tell you that the general view of, if the weather is clear, shipping is good, is certainly a mantra that we do not disagree with.

I will tell you that the general view of, if the weather is clear, shipping is good, is certainly a mantra that we do not disagree with. So I'll leave it at that and I hope that that's responsive to your question.",

      "text": "Q: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So just following on that question with regards to congestion and \u2013 if we do see a very significant increase in economic activity potentially above and beyond what's currently expected, how much of your ability to protect services within \u2013 is outside of your control? In other words, what can you do here to speak to your supply chain partners to make sure that everything remains fluid and how much of a risk is that? And just as a follow-on question there, on yields, I think you mentioned that yields were going to be negative for the year and I'm just curious with everything going on with that demand and the potential pricing opportunities, are you still expecting yields to be negative for this year?\nA: Let me start on both and then I'll turn it over to first probably Kenny and Eric to comment on specifics about congestion and how do we avoid it. I don't think we've said anything about negative yields in the year, Jennifer. No, we said the business mix is expected to be negative. Right. But not the overall yield. So when you think about yields, obviously there's numerous components. There's the mix impact, which we do expect is going to be pressured. Probably going to look a little bit better here in the second quarter and third quarter, probably some pressure in the fourth quarter with some of the grain comps. But in terms of pricing, feel very good about pricing and then fuel surcharges, this is the last quarter where we've got a pretty negative comparison year-over-year relative to fuel prices and surcharges. And so that should look better over the balance of the year as well. Yeah, I'm sorry. When Walter said yields, I went to how we define yields which is predominantly price, effective price. So, Walter, talking a little bit about congestion and if economic activity surprises us and is even stronger and continues to strengthen, what are we going to do about avoiding congestion? And the short answer is making sure that we've got the right resources against it, staying ahead of it through the viewpoint of Kenny and his team in terms of translating economic activity into carloads for us, which we do routinely and periodically to try to stay out in front. And I also need to make sure we talk, Kenny and Eric both talked about us having a full supply chain visibility and working towards that specifically with the West Coast ports. That's an active engagement, whether it's in the LA Basin or up in the PNW on our part to make sure that we and the entire supply chain have transparency and visibility into what's happening, what the metrics are and KPIs need to be for us to stay fluid and support an excellent service product. And from my perspective, that's not just about satisfying current demand. That's about making sure that the West Coast ports are competitive in a very, very competitive world where stuff can hit Prince Rupert or the Gulf Coast or the East Coast. Eric? Yeah. I'll take on the resources and hand over for the visibility. So when you think about, Walter, the resource base, right, you're talking about three things. You're talking about locomotives, so obviously we have reported that we have 3,000 plus locomotives in storage. But we also more importantly to respond to that growth is we have our at-the-ready locomotives that are actually preplaced out in geographical areas like the LA Basin, so we can be very agile in responding to that. From a car perspective, we don't have any constraints on that. Now, as Kenny mentioned earlier, you're trying to drive Intermodal velocity higher and higher, which just allows you to turn the cars faster and provide you even more at the readies for cars as well. And then crew base-wise, still use the same process we use every single month to evaluate crew demands. See, as Jennifer mentioned, there may be sporadic hiring. Some of that may be in the LA Basin, but no immediate concerns on crews. And then finally it's the agility for decision-making. When I talked about increasing the train counts of the LA Basin by 25%, that was a decision we started on Monday and by Wednesday we're already moving the resources there to answer that call. So I feel very comfortable on the operating side. Yeah. Just to add to that, we stay very coordinated with the customers on what they plan to do, on what their forecasts are, and then we're in turn taking that and sitting down with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made. We've got visibility just talking to our customers from that perspective. Obviously here this year we made some changes to our accessorial charges to incentivize our customers to get the equipment moving. Regardless, whether it's our equipment or their equipment, we are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency and turn times and dwell and things they can do to get the network moving. So, boy, we feel really good about the visibility there and the coordination there and the decisiveness there to keep the network moving.",

Just to add to that, we stay very coordinated with the customers on what they plan to do, on what their forecasts are, and then we're in turn taking that and sitting down with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made. We've got visibility just talking to our customers from that perspective. Obviously here this year we made some changes to our accessorial charges to incentivize our customers to get the equipment moving. Regardless, whether it's our equipment or their equipment, we are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency and turn times and dwell and things they can do to get the network moving. So, boy, we feel really good about the visibility there and the coordination there and the decisiveness there to keep the network moving.",

        "question": "Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So just following on that question with regards to congestion and \u2013 if we do see a very significant increase in economic activity potentially above and beyond what's currently expected, how much of your ability to protect services within \u2013 is outside of your control? In other words, what can you do here to speak to your supply chain partners to make sure that everything remains fluid and how much of a risk is that? And just as a follow-on question there, on yields, I think you mentioned that yields were going to be negative for the year and I'm just curious with everything going on with that demand and the potential pricing opportunities, are you still expecting yields to be negative for this year?",
        "answer": "Let me start on both and then I'll turn it over to first probably Kenny and Eric to comment on specifics about congestion and how do we avoid it. I don't think we've said anything about negative yields in the year, Jennifer. No, we said the business mix is expected to be negative. Right. But not the overall yield. So when you think about yields, obviously there's numerous components. There's the mix impact, which we do expect is going to be pressured. Probably going to look a little bit better here in the second quarter and third quarter, probably some pressure in the fourth quarter with some of the grain comps. But in terms of pricing, feel very good about pricing and then fuel surcharges, this is the last quarter where we've got a pretty negative comparison year-over-year relative to fuel prices and surcharges. And so that should look better over the balance of the year as well. Yeah, I'm sorry. When Walter said yields, I went to how we define yields which is predominantly price, effective price. So, Walter, talking a little bit about congestion and if economic activity surprises us and is even stronger and continues to strengthen, what are we going to do about avoiding congestion? And the short answer is making sure that we've got the right resources against it, staying ahead of it through the viewpoint of Kenny and his team in terms of translating economic activity into carloads for us, which we do routinely and periodically to try to stay out in front. And I also need to make sure we talk, Kenny and Eric both talked about us having a full supply chain visibility and working towards that specifically with the West Coast ports. That's an active engagement, whether it's in the LA Basin or up in the PNW on our part to make sure that we and the entire supply chain have transparency and visibility into what's happening, what the metrics are and KPIs need to be for us to stay fluid and support an excellent service product. And from my perspective, that's not just about satisfying current demand. That's about making sure that the West Coast ports are competitive in a very, very competitive world where stuff can hit Prince Rupert or the Gulf Coast or the East Coast. Eric? Yeah. I'll take on the resources and hand over for the visibility. So when you think about, Walter, the resource base, right, you're talking about three things. You're talking about locomotives, so obviously we have reported that we have 3,000 plus locomotives in storage. But we also more importantly to respond to that growth is we have our at-the-ready locomotives that are actually preplaced out in geographical areas like the LA Basin, so we can be very agile in responding to that. From a car perspective, we don't have any constraints on that. Now, as Kenny mentioned earlier, you're trying to drive Intermodal velocity higher and higher, which just allows you to turn the cars faster and provide you even more at the readies for cars as well. And then crew base-wise, still use the same process we use every single month to evaluate crew demands. See, as Jennifer mentioned, there may be sporadic hiring. Some of that may be in the LA Basin, but no immediate concerns on crews. And then finally it's the agility for decision-making. When I talked about increasing the train counts of the LA Basin by 25%, that was a decision we started on Monday and by Wednesday we're already moving the resources there to answer that call. So I feel very comfortable on the operating side. Yeah. Just to add to that, we stay very coordinated with the customers on what they plan to do, on what their forecasts are, and then we're in turn taking that and sitting down with Eric and so he talked about the adjustments that we've made.

Let me just comment and I'll flip it over to Peter here for any additional color. You're right to portray the focus that we have BMC being very strong. But I would highlight what Peter said earlier, even in the BMC legacy footprint, it was a very targeted approach to multi-family in key markets in the South, a little bit up in the East and somewhat up in California in the West Coast. It was not broad-based. And I think that our targeted market focus is exactly why we had such success. We knew where those markets were going to be strong for some period of time and that's where we have the capability and our team was just fantastic in driving growth. Yeah.

And it's a little hard to communicate that when we're talking about comparisons to national metrics. But we think we're doing really well with that business.

Our expectation is that the hurricane comps hurt us by about a point year-over-year. And so while none of us loves putting a kind of 1%- ish number on the table as a guidance for a quarter, which is our expectation for U.S. system-wide, that number based on hurricane comps alone would be about two points, if it weren't for that.

That certainly could be a wild card. What we have seen in the industry is it slowed down during the summer months. As one would expect, the weather seems to be more conducive in the winter when it's cold and damp. But, we've also seen a lot of the producers really increase their bio-security.

        "question": "Y ou had mentioned PED briefly. I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more of your thoughts on what you've seen so far, now that we're getting into the early months of the cold winter weather. And then, how do you anticipate potential impact on profitability if prevalence is greater or less than maybe what you are expecting?",
        "answer": "Right, Mario. This is Jody. That certainly could be a wild card. What we have seen in the industry is it slowed down during the summer months. As one would expect, the weather seems to be more conducive in the winter when it's cold and damp. But, we've also seen a lot of the producers really increase their bio-security. And I think that will have a positive impact on any further spread of the disease. So, our assumption is that hog production should grow in the 3% to 3.5% for the industry as a whole and that assumes that there is a lot less impact than there was last year on PED.",

Insulet stands out as having a lot of China manufacturing exposure You touched on this in the prepared remarks and you have done a great job ramping up with the new manufacturing facility, I believe. Line one is up, line two is on its way, and line three is being built. But how should we think about when you'll have much more dependence on the US manufacturing versus outside the US in case this lasts for much longer?\nA: Hi, Robbie. It's Wayde. I can take that one. The teams saw this risk several years ago when they laid out the multiyear strategy and, obviously, made a significant investment. I know you've seen it here as well. And to your point, that's giving a lot of tailwinds to the team here during this current challenge that we've got two lines up and running, now, and producing. And that's allowing us to actually build inventory through this time; and so, being able to stay ahead of demand and demand that's overachieving or outperforming our base scenarios. Regarding the risk in China, I mean, we've got a really strong partner in China. I think we're very impressed by how quickly they took on the challenge and were able to staff, recruit, onboard, train and safely move people into the facility and get our production up. It was clearly delayed from a typical year-end start. But given the environment, we were impressed by how quickly both the third-party team and our operations teams worked together. I highlighted here some of the costs. We put some incentives in place to help fund some of the work that our third-party manufacturer was doing and some of the extent they were going to get employees into the facility to get producing for us again after the New Year. So, I think we're going to see a multi-facility strategy from us going forward. And one of the main drivers for our US manufacturing facility was to get redundancy, and we'll have redundancy once we have three and four lines running here in the US and keeping our China manufacturing facilities. So, we'll achieve that objective once we get our third line up, and then eventually onto our fourth line. Next question, please.",

      "text": "Q: Hi. Thank you, good afternoon. Two questions. First, I believe that you have a pretty sizeable expansion of your value-priced rooms in Florida coming up later this year. Can you speak a bit more broadly about why value-priced, how we should think about the impact that that will have on your economics and everything from occupancy to the ability to push more people through the parks, first of all. And then second of all, a topic we've discussed in the past, but any update on your sort of position toward the use of leverage? Obviously, last fall you were able to borrow incredibly cheaply, you're still relatively \u2013 have a low level of debt financing relative to your peers and given some of your CapEx and the fact that you have such great subscription fees coming in what's the philosophy there? Thanks.\nA: We are, you're correct, Michael, we're opening the Art of Animation Resort, actually, it's opening in waves and most of what we're opening are family suites. Where we've seen a real demand in the marketplace, we actually converted some of our space in some of our other hotels to family suites. And we will be opening different parts of this hotel over the next year, year and a half, most of which will be in the family suite category and to put that in perspective, I don't have the pricing in front of me directly but my recollection is that we're selling family suites for somewhere in the neighborhood of $200 to $225 a night. These have been very, very popular in the marketplace. And we thought we wanted to expand. Obviously, a family suite is designed to accommodate an entire family. And for that price, we think that this is \u2013 it's right to call this a value room or a value accommodation. We've seen a fair amount of demand in this space over the last five or so years, actually probably longer. As we've said before, if you look at our profile, particularly into that category as of the first quarter that we just announced. Obviously when we open this new resort, which is very, very large that number is going to grow somewhat. I think it reflects what's going on in the marketplace in some respects. But it also reflects the popularity of our product and the fact that we're now making it more accessible to more people because of the affordability factor. And for people to be able to come and stay in a room like the ones that we're building for that price is a pretty good deal. Do you want to answer the second question? Yes. Mike, relative to your leverage question, so, you're absolutely right in stating that we have been to the market multiple times in the past year. I want to add, because I'm very proud of it and proud of our team, but for what we borrowed in both the amounts and our rating, we really almost always in the past year saw historically low coupon rates on that debt. And whereas, you know, a couple have been better since then, I think we've timed our steps into the debt marketplace very carefully and put a lot of time into picking what we think will be a low entry points and we've been very successful in doing that. In doing so, we've obviously increased our debt because of the availability of money at these great rates. But I think that one of the reasons why we kind of, you know, punch beyond our weight in the debt market is because we have been so strategic and so public and so consistent in wanting to keep a single-A rating on our balance sheet and go to the market with that consistent message, we have no intention at the current time to change that. There is some \u2013 we could continue to leverage up somewhat and stay below that sort of, you know, 2.0 gross debt ratio that will keep us at that single-A and we won't push ourselves beyond that. I think there's a little more capacity. When we see opportunities to step out, again, we've got a couple of maturities that we'd like to fill in and when we see the opportunity to step in at great rates I think you'll see us doing that. Of course, you know, as time passes we'll have some maturities that we'll refill but don't expect us to back the truck up to the point where we have to give up that great debt \u2013 that great balance sheet and great Standard & Poor's rating that has I think saved \u2013 served us incredibly well over the past decade including when liquidity dried up for most companies in 2008.",

And then just I think you mentioned biofuel now for at least a couple quarters. I'm just curious of that opportunity now and perhaps the scope and size of that opportunity down the road. Thanks.\nA: So, Jordan, this is Jennifer. Certainly, second quarter should look better. Last year's second quarter was obviously with the pandemic greatly impacted especially with the auto production which was virtually stopped. Now, we do still have some auto production headwinds this year that's a little bit of a headwind, but we're expecting it to look better. Whether it will turn positive in the second quarter, I think that is really going to be dependent on the mix. But we feel good about the direction that things are going particularly in the back half. Yeah. So biofuels, we've been very encouraged with where we are today with that and we're even more encouraged with where we see it by the end of the year and long term. We do see that renewable diesel has legs. We've been working with customers to land sites on our network, and we feel really good about that. We talked to a growing number of customers that are interested and have committed capital dollars to investment, so we know it's real. So that's why you're seeing that optimism there from us on the biofuels standpoint.",

      "text": "Q: Hi, everybody. First, just to clean up a couple things on the guidance, do you have a bed growth number on the psych side? And would you highlight on the acute side, any unusual items that are beyond just sort of the expectations for same-store revenue and EBITDA growth, maybe supplemental payment changes or I know the health plan has been a drag. Do you continue to expect that to be a drag above and beyond what the acute business does? Anything that's unusual that we might want to factor into our modeling on the acute side?\nA: Sure, A.J. So, I think your questions surrounded mostly the acute care business. As I said, same-store revenue growth on the acute side is sort of 5%, 6% in the model. We acknowledge that that's kind of on the high end of what seems to be sort of industry averages. Although, there's not a great many good public company comparisons for our acute care business any longer. I will say that most of that number is based on our historical trends over the last couple years. While I think that's a strong number, it's reflective of the sorts of experience we've had over the last few years and the strong performance, particularly in a number of our better kind of stronger franchise markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, D.C., et cetera. I will also say, however, that I think that number is inflated, particularly in 2019, by some of the increased capital spending that we've seen over the last few years. I mean, our overall capital spend has gone from roughly $350 million three or four years ago to closer to $700 million in 2018 and again in 2019. Some of that has been real big-ticket items, like the new hospital in Henderson, but a lot of that is just continuing to enhance our franchises. We've added beds to our Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas. We've added beds to Henderson, even though it's only a couple years old. We've added beds to Summerlin in Las Vegas. We've added a very large new emergency room project to our hospital in Manatee, Florida or Bradenton, Florida. We've added emergency room capacity in beds to our hospital in Denison which is in the North Dallas market. So I do think that some of that acute care revenue growth is embedded in our guidance as well. As far as the health plan goes, as we talked about over the last several years, the health plan has been steadily improving. The guidance for next year continues to expect it to improve. I would say it's a kind of smaller incremental improvement next year, maybe in the $8 million to $10 million range. And then, the offset to all that is, as you mentioned, is the supplemental payments. I mean, we've got a schedule in the 10-K that projects this or lays out the supplemental payments over the last several years and projects the 2019 number. And in 2019, we're expecting a measurable decline in supplemental payments. All that of course is included in the guide.",

I will say that most of that number is based on our historical trends over the last couple years. While I think that's a strong number, it's reflective of the sorts of experience we've had over the last few years and the strong performance, particularly in a number of our better kind of stronger franchise markets like Las Vegas, Southern California, D.C., et cetera. I will also say, however, that I think that number is inflated, particularly in 2019, by some of the increased capital spending that we've seen over the last few years. I mean, our overall capital spend has gone from roughly $350 million three or four years ago to closer to $700 million in 2018 and again in 2019. Some of that has been real big-ticket items, like the new hospital in Henderson, but a lot of that is just continuing to enhance our franchises. We've added beds to our Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas. We've added beds to Henderson, even though it's only a couple years old. We've added beds to Summerlin in Las Vegas. We've added a very large new emergency room project to our hospital in Manatee, Florida or Bradenton, Florida. We've added emergency room capacity in beds to our hospital in Denison which is in the North Dallas market. So I do think that some of that acute care revenue growth is embedded in our guidance as well. As far as the health plan goes, as we talked about over the last several years, the health plan has been steadily improving. The guidance for next year continues to expect it to improve. I would say it's a kind of smaller incremental improvement next year, maybe in the $8 million to $10 million range. And then, the offset to all that is, as you mentioned, is the supplemental payments. I mean, we've got a schedule in the 10-K that projects this or lays out the supplemental payments over the last several years and projects the 2019 number. And in 2019, we're expecting a measurable decline in supplemental payments. All that of course is included in the guide.",

        "question": "Hi, everybody. First, just to clean up a couple things on the guidance, do you have a bed growth number on the psych side? And would you highlight on the acute side, any unusual items that are beyond just sort of the expectations for same-store revenue and EBITDA growth, maybe supplemental payment changes or I know the health plan has been a drag. Do you continue to expect that to be a drag above and beyond what the acute business does? Anything that's unusual that we might want to factor into our modeling on the acute side?",
        "answer": "Sure, A.J. So, I think your questions surrounded mostly the acute care business. As I said, same-store revenue growth on the acute side is sort of 5%, 6% in the model. We acknowledge that that's kind of on the high end of what seems to be sort of industry averages. Although, there's not a great many good public company comparisons for our acute care business any longer.

So we're absolutely seeing more momentum around governments and owners mandating BIM as part of their building process and as part of their specification process. We expect this to continue as time goes on. You remember what happened with the UK mandates and how that drove some pretty intense adoption of Revit in the UK markets and surrounding markets. You're going to see more and more of those. It's just part of what's going to happen. We're very interested in seeing BIM-based permitting processes get into government entities as well. That's going to be something that we'd like to be part of helping people understand and do. Now, when it comes to the manufacturing opportunity, what you said there about it being somewhat further out, I think what you're seeing right now and especially with our execution is, on the construction side, you've got this perfect storm of technology is ready, the mobile platform as it is today and the cloud is absolutely 100% suited to what the construction industry needs. The customers are ready, they know they have to digitize and the products are ready. That's why you see this intense doubling down on the construction opportunity in the near term right now. You look at manufacturing, tools like generative and some of these other tools, IoT, by the way, we just see IoT as an input to generative. That's how you collect data and you use it to put information in. It's something that we pioneered with the Hack Rod initiative a couple of years back. These initiatives are all very much in the exploratory stages of manufacturers, large and small, and what they're doing is they're sitting there going, wow, I know that these technologies, the cloud, high-performance computing in the cloud, connected workflows, generative, all of these things are going to have a big impact on my business. I just don't know how I'm going to deploy them yet. So you'll see those start to get much more traction over an 18 or 24-month horizon, whereas construction is kind of a now opportunity.

And then if there's a way to quantify volume and price ex -Crop Protection?\nA: Y eah, I mean so look, we are a value in use seller. It is the genetics; it is the capability of our seeds that creates the opportunity for us there. And farmers make the choice of the seed first. But, Jim, why don't you elaborate on that? Well, a number of different aspects there. So first of all, farmers are obviously scrutinizing pretty closely all of their input purchases. But that said, as Ellen said, as we deliver more value to the farmer, wh atever the commodity price, that's reflected in \u2013 we can capture part of that value. So we're continuing to move forward there. You asked about cost. If I go back to the Fresh Start work that we worked across corporately, obviously the Ag businesses were a part of that. So we've really been working on streamlining the operating model. Productivity is a way of life so we're constantly looking for ways to improve productivity, to speed up operations and focus our costs. Y ou asked a little bit how that might impact R&D investments. I think the way I would describe that is we are fully funding the strategic research projects that are going to drive the pipeline and the future value. Continue as you normally would around making sure that we're really focused on the most important opportunities. So R&D investment will continue strongly, particularly in the most important projects. Y eah. As far as the seed Pioneer split goes... Seed Crop Protection. Y es, I'm sorry, Seed Crop Protection. Crop Protection's sales weren't as impacted as Pioneer's were. They did a little better from that standpoint, so plus or minus around that decline is Pioneer is a little above and Crop's a little below. But a lot of that's going to play out. The season's not over yet. There's still a lot of opportunity coming through North America in the second quarter and getting prepared for the summer safrinha season in Brazil. So a lot of time left in this season for this year. And we're really excited about the products and the progress that we're making. We have time for one last question.",

And farmers make the choice of the seed first. But, Jim, why don't you elaborate on that? Well, a number of different aspects there. So first of all, farmers are obviously scrutinizing pretty closely all of their input purchases. But that said, as Ellen said, as we deliver more value to the farmer, wh atever the commodity price, that's reflected in \u2013 we can capture part of that value. So we're continuing to move forward there. You asked about cost. If I go back to the Fresh Start work that we worked across corporately, obviously the Ag businesses were a part of that. So we've really been working on streamlining the operating model. Productivity is a way of life so we're constantly looking for ways to improve productivity, to speed up operations and focus our costs. Y ou asked a little bit how that might impact R&D investments. I think the way I would describe that is we are fully funding the strategic research projects that are going to drive the pipeline and the future value. Continue as you normally would around making sure that we're really focused on the most important opportunities. So R&D investment will continue strongly, particularly in the most important projects. Y eah. As far as the seed Pioneer split goes... Seed Crop Protection. Y es, I'm sorry, Seed Crop Protection. Crop Protection's sales weren't as impacted as Pioneer's were. They did a little better from that standpoint, so plus or minus around that decline is Pioneer is a little above and Crop's a little below. But a lot of that's going to play out. The season's not over yet. There's still a lot of opportunity coming through North America in the second quarter and getting prepared for the summer safrinha season in Brazil. So a lot of time left in this season for this year. And we're really excited about the products and the progress that we're making. We have time for one last question.",

      "text": "Q: Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats. I guess, my first question, when we think about kind of normalizing over time, we would normally think 2022 Merchant would be 130% to 135% of 2019. And, I guess, I'm wondering, A, is that still possible? You're at a nice trajectory. And maybe if you could bucket what are the parts of the business that still have a lot of room to come back? What have some room to come back? And what are already \u2013 like, what percent are already on like a good traction? Because, I guess, if we know there's a lot to still come back, we could kind of get to that 130% to 135%. So, I guess, all those are kind of the question around just recovery.\nA: Yes, Dave. It's Cameron. Maybe I'll kick off and ask Paul to fill in some of the more explicit details. But if I step back and kind of think about where we are today, if you look at our pure acquiring businesses globally, they were up roughly 19% in the second quarter versus 2019 levels. In the US, that number was 25%. So, again, I think we feel from a pure acquiring standpoint, we're on a pretty good trajectory. Now, what still needs to come back to kind of get to 2022 a more normalized rate of growth relative to 2019 or, to say it differently, where we would have been absent the pandemic; well, Europe is growing relative to 2019, but it's certainly growing at a pace lower than that which we've seen in the US market. So, Europe grew somewhere in the high single-digits versus 2019 for the second quarter. So, we still need a little more tailwind from Europe fully recovering. As you know, the UK didn't open up until mid-July. So, as we get to the back half of the year, we're expecting to see a little more tailwind in Europe as it relates to growth, particularly, relative to 2019 trends. And then, of course, Asia, which is a small part of the business, but it's still lagging relative to 2019 levels, largely because many markets continue to struggle with the pandemic remain closed. And, of course, cross-border activity in Asia is very depressed and continues to be depressed because of the pandemic. So, as we think about 2022, I think the US is on a pretty good trajectory to get back to something reasonably close to what we would have been absent the pandemic, given the outsized growth and the momentum we have in that business. We need Europe to continue to improve as the lockdowns and markets begin to reopen and you see more cross-border travel pick up. And then, I'd say the same thing is true for Asia, just given where it sits relative to the pandemic. I think the vertical markets are well poised to get back to reasonable levels compared to 2019 as we continue to see, again, a recovery in schools and a recovery in active in the back half of the year as those markets in particular reopen. So, Paul, I don't know if you'd add anything more to that, but I think that gives a pretty good overview of the Merchant business. Yes. I think it sums it up. Good. I think I'd also just add on the Issuer. So, Paul can comment here, too, Dave. But we produced a fantastic quarter, this quarter in Issuer. But I would say, in particular, the non-US businesses echo a lot of what Cameron said. So, we only recently, which is to say really the second quarter heading into July and continuing in July, we've only recently seen kind of a reopening, for Issuer purposes, of a lot of markets outside the United States. That will be a favorable comparison, Dave, to answer your question for the first half, obviously, of next year. And I'd add to that commercial card. So, while commercial card, not surprisingly, is up versus 2020, it's really not up versus 2019. So, I think it's a pretty good picture, Dave, heading into 2022 on the Issuer side as well because you do have those two elements of broader reopening outside the United States and commercial card relative to 2019 starting normalize that should be favorable elements for the Issuer business. And lastly, I'd say on Issuer, we described again today is, Ashwin asked, but those LOIs start to kick in. We start getting in the back half of 2022. We obviously also had announced Truist probably about a year-and-a-half ago now, I think we said at the time that's a back half 2022 event, which we continue to believe. So, I think you're going to get \u2013 some of the comments that Cameron made on Merchant, you are going to get a nice tailwind heading into 2022 on Issuer as well.",

I can't remember, whether it was three months or six months ago but on this call, you had said that you set your teammates down and you said look we have to have a conversation with our clients. They should expect rate increases coming through and we're now six months past the hurricanes. To what extent is that materializing as planned? Two, to what extent are those rate increases hurricane related and after we get through the reactionary price increases associated with the hurricanes we re-enter a stable market?\nA: So I think first of all, yes it is mostly hurricane-related property, non-cat exposed is up, cat exposed where there were losses are up probably 10% to even a little bit more than 10%. And those that are not cat exposed that didn't burn the market, you're still looking at 3% to 5%. And I think that when you think about where the rates were pre- hurricanes, they were as low as they've been in over a decade. So I do think that the rate increases are justified, they are selling in the market now. Some of the quotes that originally came out at more like 20%, 25% increases are that those aren't going to hold. But I don't see a return to a vast soft market anytime quickly. Once the balance sheets have had a chance to heal a little bit and the wind doesn't blow, then you'll see the rates come down again.",

        "question": "Thank you. I can't remember, whether it was three months or six months ago but on this call, you had said that you set your teammates down and you said look we have to have a conversation with our clients. They should expect rate increases coming through and we're now six months past the hurricanes. To what extent is that materializing as planned? Two, to what extent are those rate increases hurricane related and after we get through the reactionary price increases associated with the hurricanes we re-enter a stable market?",
        "answer": "So I think first of all, yes it is mostly hurricane-related property, non-cat exposed is up, cat exposed where there were losses are up probably 10% to even a little bit more than 10%. And those that are not cat exposed that didn't burn the market, you're still looking at 3% to 5%. And I think that when you think about where the rates were pre- hurricanes, they were as low as they've been in over a decade. So I do think that the rate increases are justified, they are selling in the market now. Some of the quotes that originally came out at more like 20%, 25% increases are that those aren't going to hold. But I don't see a return to a vast soft market anytime quickly. Once the balance sheets have had a chance to heal a little bit and the wind doesn't blow, then you'll see the rates come down again.",

Now, also there were benefits in most historical principal investments historically. But in this environment, obviously, you don't see that.

I think, earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the Banking & Markets business, you can see the Banking & Markets ROE right now, and also the forward ROE of the Asset & Wealth Management business with less capital on it. The drag from the platforms is getting smaller. And over the next 12 to 24 months, it'll get smaller, too, hopefully eradicated, and so that will give you a cleaner ROE.

I would say first of all, we do have two really important renovation projects going on in 2023. No surprise. Barbados was crushing it for the past year as you think about leisure demand and as we really do a very full renovation of these properties, that will have an impact on unleased profits. I would expect termination fees to be a bit lower as we look at 2023 versus 2022. We had a couple other things that are close to offsetting. If you remember in Q1 in particular of 2022, we had the German subsidies. So they hit in Q1 of 2022, and we obviously will not have them in Q1 of 2023. We also had an agreement on a pack of leased US hotels that involved a charge later in the year in 2022, and obviously we won't have that in 2023.

John, I wanted to just talk about some of the new things we saw this quarter, heard on the call, and a couple of things that sort of popped out to me were the CCRCs that you purchased during the quarter. And then separately, when I heard you talking about. John, you mentioned the ability to do sort of redevelopment and real estate value-add opportunities. So could you expand on sort of these two pieces, one sort of just the interest level and the \u2013 or increased interest level in the entrance fee communities and the return profile for those types of assets? And then maybe what specifically or maybe, even generically you're thinking in terms of redevelopment or value-add dollars or opportunities?\nA: Those are two very good questions, Jordan, and thank you for getting two questions through the first time on the line. So, I'll answer both and I hope I can remember it. So, let's just try first, it's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities, we are value-driven real estate investors, we saw a tremendous opportunity because of the dirt. So, if I give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit and with remarkable dirt, right? So, to talk about Westchester, New York; Dana Point, California; Bellevue, Washington; Alexandria, that level, that kind of dirt. And then we thought, what we can do with the dirt, right? So, I mentioned, obviously, there's an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residential area of Bellevue, right? So, when we look at a lot of CCRCs, we continue to \u2013 we always have, we continue to look at \u2013 it's just we've never seen this kind of opportunity, where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up, obviously, what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dirt, right? With the current entitlement. That's why we're interested in. We \u2013 as I mentioned, I'll give you details of what I think that it can go from a high- single-digit unlevered IRR to a low-double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought \u2013 that's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it, between 9% to 12%, 13% unlevered IRR, most of the transaction we have done and the return lies right there. Our focus on the real estate value add, one of the big real estate value-add that this company tried to do is Vintage, as you are well aware of the fact, that hasn't played out well for us. So, as I've gone through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously we thought and we stop that whole focus on relative value-add in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on that strategy. So when we're talking to John going back few months ago, that's something that came up and now obviously, John is immersed into the portfolio and he's obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee. So those opportunities we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on. It also adds to what I mentioned that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Ferry. We brought in Mike over a year ago and he has built a very large team. And so, those are all \u2013 those stars are all coming together, right?

So, let's just try first, it's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities, we are value-driven real estate investors, we saw a tremendous opportunity because of the dirt. So, if I give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit and with remarkable dirt, right? So, to talk about Westchester, New York; Dana Point, California; Bellevue, Washington; Alexandria, that level, that kind of dirt. And then we thought, what we can do with the dirt, right? So, I mentioned, obviously, there's an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residential area of Bellevue, right? So, when we look at a lot of CCRCs, we continue to \u2013 we always have, we continue to look at \u2013 it's just we've never seen this kind of opportunity, where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up, obviously, what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dirt, right? With the current entitlement. That's why we're interested in. We \u2013 as I mentioned, I'll give you details of what I think that it can go from a high- single-digit unlevered IRR to a low-double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought \u2013 that's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it, between 9% to 12%, 13% unlevered IRR, most of the transaction we have done and the return lies right there. Our focus on the real estate value add, one of the big real estate value-add that this company tried to do is Vintage, as you are well aware of the fact, that hasn't played out well for us. So, as I've gone through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously we thought and we stop that whole focus on relative value-add in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on that strategy. So when we're talking to John going back few months ago, that's something that came up and now obviously, John is immersed into the portfolio and he's obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee. So those opportunities we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on. It also adds to what I mentioned that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Ferry. We brought in Mike over a year ago and he has built a very large team. And so, those are all \u2013 those stars are all coming together, right? But it's a skill set we didn't have and now we do have it.",

And it's really remarkable that you haven't had a big blowup that's come back to hit you or your peers so far. But how are you protecting yourself against I guess the likelihood there's going to be some third-party problem that could ricochet back on you, I'm talking about outside of, say, the largest US banks which have reported now? And then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines. How long does that last? Thanks.\nA: So, Mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. I'd just start by the fact that this firm has a very, very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation, and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. So, I've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that I think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. I think we've taken a number of actions inside the firm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about RWA allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difficult environment. Now, obviously, we have exposure to that because we're a large financial firm, so you can't 100% protect yourself from that. But there's no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. I think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buffer during the quarter. I think that's reflective of a conscious decision in this environment to run a little bit more cautiously, a little bit more conservatively. We've been watching what's been going on in markets across the UK, and when we see things like that, we reflect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be amplified. And so, we're extremely focused on issues like that. And I would just say that I think the world is fragile at the moment and it's uncertain and we're operating through that lens. We're a big financial institution, so we have exposure. If there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them, but on the other hand, I think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise and we're well capitalized and we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders.",

      "text": "Q: Got it. Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, for you first. You made some constructive comments about what you're seeing in the AEC business. But more broadly, and as you're well aware, there's quite a bit of ferment going on in that market right now in terms of references to what's come to be called BIM 2.0. As you know, just a couple of months ago at an AEC conference, a customer group launched a new customer-developed design specification for software. You yourselves are working on dual track of enhancing Revit, but focusing on Forma. So, lots going on in terms of there is currents in that industry or part of the industry. Help us understand how you're thinking about managing through all those different dynamics that are going on in the AEC industry. And then a follow-up.\nA: Yeah. So, thanks, Jay. There's three threads to this, all right. One is kind of the core platform thread around data and data flow. At the root of all this, we need to make sure as much of the data that we have locked inside Revit files and locked in other types of files that our customers have gets turned into APIs wherever possible, right? This is a lubricant to the workflow that people are worried about and a big part of really what underpins the whole concept of BIM 2.0. That's one of the things. The second piece is you've got to make sure that their ability to do detailed, in-depth, complicated, sophisticated BIM models gets more performant, more productive, and faster. That's core to kind of building up and improving Revit in some significant ways, which we're absolutely looking up. The third point, which I think is more important, is you really need to reimagine how BIM is being done. The paradigm needs to shift, and it needs to shift to the world of not only being cloud enabled but also being what we really like to call augmented design enabled or outcome based in whatever language we use so that you can actually change the way people do BIM. And that's one of the big things that we're focusing on with Forma and that's very different than \u2013 we have certain types of competitors. It's in line with what the spec is from the customers. But when you talk about data, Revit improvements, and the move to what we call augmented design or outcome-based design, those are the big thrusts in terms of what we're trying to do to bring the industry to a better way of doing BIM.",

I guess, the question is, as we look ahead to 2022 and make whatever assumption we want around lumber prices and the top line impact there, is that the same type of incremental margin we should be kind of looking for presumably on the way down? Or do you have any thoughts around anything you're doing internally around pricing or things like that that could kind of dampen that impact?\nA: Yeah. So, I think the way down versus way up comment is exactly why we did slide 5. I think that was really our intent is to help people understand where it wants to be when commodity prices are at that $400. So, I think that's a really healthy way to look at it. I just remind everybody how dynamic this year has been, how volatile. I mean, these words coming from the guy who thought we were going to descend gently from our roughly $900 or $1,000 commodity levels back when the last time we met on this call. It's been a heck of a ride since. And I think what you're seeing in these numbers is a lot of the impact of that volatility in one way, shape or form. So, that expectation of it going back to the $15.3 billion and the $1.6 billion number for 2021, we really wanted you to have that as it gives you a sense of what we think the base business really looks like, and hopefully, that answered your question appropriately.",

And after \u2013 I honestly think \u2013 I think since I picked up coverage of this back when you originally turned public, we've at least had conversations about when your small business owners to medium-sized business owners are going to start thinking more about the value proposition of having backup power. It sounds like from your prepared remarks, you're starting to see more progress there. Why now? Is it the health of the economy? Is it the outage activity that people are seeing broadly? I mean, why do you think it's happening now and how sustainable? And maybe just some thoughts around that.\nA: Yeah. So I think there's a couple of larger factors at play there, Mike. The first is just the macro trend of outages, right? I mean, even though we went through a period of low outages, outages, when you look over a 30-year period, have been increasing. And so, if you're a business owner, the prospect of losing power and the disruption that that causes to your operations, and in particular today, the digitization of business, the economy, the impact on productivity when you lose a continuous supply of power is unbelievable. I mean, things stop and get very primitive very quickly. It's one thing for a homeowner, right? There's the inconvenience factor in most cases or property damage, other things that are severe. But, for a business person, you're talking about a disruption in livelihood. And especially if you're in a significantly prone area to outages, it's almost untenable to think you wouldn't have \u2013 we all have disaster recovery plans and other risk mitigation plans in our businesses today. This just becomes an element of that in my mind. So it's become a part of managing that what is, for most people, a real risk of losing power. So, I think there's that piece of it. I think the other piece of it, though, is that the product offering, again, when you look at natural gas, becoming more available, becoming more ubiquitous, it's affordable. So when you look at smaller businesses, this is not something that you have to think of in terms of a 10-year payback. A reciprocating engine driven genset powered on natural gas can pay back in one outage for a small business. We've said this before. Eight hours of outage for a grocery store or a small gas station can be paid for. The entire genset's paid for in that single outage. So, I think the ROI is very strong for the category. A lot of that is because that cost position on the product has come down very nicely over the last couple decades. I think with the favorable economic environment backdrop that's helping, too, with the strong residential construction, you see buildings being built everywhere. Everywhere you travel, that's helping obviously, and you alluded to that, Mike, but I think the regulatory impacts, too. When you have outages, then, you tend to get more discussion around the regulatory impacts, and we see that in the Florida healthcare opportunity. And then, you start getting more dialogue about telecom and having mandates around backup power on cell towers. And so, I think you put all of those factors together and all that's driving our C&I business at least domestically. And then you have all the other factors internationally as we continue to grow out our international business.",

We will continue to be an acquisitive company. We always like when the environment gets more attractive for acquisitions. But we are always looking to make sure that a potential acquisition is strategically aligned with our priorities, that means it's either accelerating an effort that we're currently working on or bringing us into an adjacency that we weren't working on but that we see as an attractive place. Timing matters as well in terms of what timing is right for us to do these things that we keep business reasonably focused on the things that are important and don't try to juggle 18 balls at once, all right? But we'll continue to be acquisitive. And we have the cash flow and balance sheet ability here to do whatever we need to do in terms of strategic fit and expansion that we're interested in moving forward. So, don't expect any change.
